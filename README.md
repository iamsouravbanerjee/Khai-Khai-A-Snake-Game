Snake, a classic arcade video game originating in the mid-1970s, has successfully stood the test of time, maintaining popularity since its inception. The game's widespread acclaim reached new heights when it became the default pre-loaded option on Nokia phones in 1998, captivating a massive audience. Players engage in navigating a snake-like creature across a bordered plane, collecting food while strategically avoiding collisions with its own tail or the enclosing "walls." The dynamic challenge intensifies as the snake's tail grows longer with each consumed piece of food. Users exert control over the snake's direction using up, down, left, or right movements, and the body obediently follows, creating a seamless and continuous gaming experience.

The pinnacle of Snake's popularity coincided with its inclusion as the preloaded game on Nokia 3310 and similar phones, making it an iconic and universally recognized part of the mobile gaming landscape. This version became synonymous with the mobile gaming experience of that era, reaching millions of users globally due to the widespread adoption of Nokia devices. Even in today's diverse technological landscape, Snake persists in various programming languages such as HTML5, Java, and Flash, showcasing its adaptability across different platforms. The game's enduring appeal lies in its simple yet engaging mechanics, ensuring its continued resonance among players of all ages around the world.

### Problem Statement: 
 - Our goal is to create a prototype of the well-known Snake Game.

### Real-world/Business Objectives and Constraints:

1. The game aims to be highly intuitive and addictive for users.
2. It should have a minimal footprint, consuming low RAM resources.
3. There are no stringent concerns regarding latency in the game's performance.
4. The development cost for this project is expected to be minimal.
5. Notably, the prototype has been built using Visual Basic 6.0, limiting compatibility to Windows systems. Additionally, it is acknowledged that the game mechanics may be considered inferior compared to Snake games on other platforms.
